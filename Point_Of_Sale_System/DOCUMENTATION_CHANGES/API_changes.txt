1. When Organization you can no longer change bussines type
2. /PutMenuItem, we have combined most of they're menu posts into one api that just updates the row for simplicity.
3. We did not use /menuItem/{menuItemId}/image API's, because we didn't need to
4. /orders/{orderId} also sends the total amount of the order
5. {orderId}/AddItems created a separate API to add items to the order
6. PUT /orders/{orderId} we made so you can not update an existing order
7. GET /orders/{orderId}/payments was removed, because we changed the logic so orders and appointments are at the top.
8. DELETE /orders/{orderId}/payments it's not logical to delete a payment
